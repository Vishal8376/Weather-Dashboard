# Weather-Dashboard

This HTML code creates a simple, responsive weather app UI.
It includes a search bar for entering a city and displays weather information like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
The layout uses CSS for styling, including a gradient background and centered card design.
Placeholder images and text are used for weather data, which can be dynamically updated later withÂ JavaScript.
